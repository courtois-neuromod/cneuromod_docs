# How to acknowledge

We kindly ask that all publications using the cneuromod data include the following paragraph in their acknowledgement section:
> The Courtois project on neural modelling was made possible by a generous donation from the Courtois foundation, administered by the Fondation Institut Gériatrie Montréal at CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’île-de-Montréal and University of Montreal. The Courtois NeuroMod team is based at "Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de Montréal", with several other institutions involved. See the cneuromod documentation for an up-to-date list of contributors (https://docs.cneuromod.ca).

Data is shared by the CNeuroMod team under a [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/). Exceptions apply for copyrighted stimuli - see  readme of each dataset for more information.

In addition, we encourage you to include the name of the cneuromod data release used in the analysis (e.g. cneuromod-2020), as well as any relevant excerpt from this documentation. Although some journals flag reproductions of technical documentation as plagiarism, using a standardized wording help consistency and reproducibility in the literature. Please reproduce this documentation verbatim to the greatest extent possible, and justify to the editor that this practice does not fall under plagiarism. Note that multiple versions of the documentation exist, one for each cneuromod release, so please make sure to use excerpts from the correct version of the documentation, matching the data release used in the analysis.
